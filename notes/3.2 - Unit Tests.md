# Unit Tests

## Testing

- Systematic attempt to find faults in a planned way in the implemented software
  - You cannot use testing to prove no defects
  - Find as many as you can to reduce embarrassment
- Fault Detection
  - Code reviews
  - Inspections/WalkThroughs
  - Execution-based testing
- Quality control should happen throughout
  - While writing Use Cases
  - While modeling the Application Domain
